Why I want to become a software engineer**
As a high school student, I took engineering technology classes. Software engineering has always been something has interested me. I took some college classes in Graphing but never finished my degree. Through the years the need for technological positions has greatly increased and working as a laborer, I realize how much harder it is to find jobs that pay well and that interest me. For a long time, I searched for a job that would fit my needs and wants. 

I currently work as a laborer and increasingly realized that I hated getting up going to job I didn't want to do, working hours on end away from my family, for little to nothing pay. I really thought for a long time, and did lots of research to find out what I should pursue. I thought back to my high school and college days and remembered how much I enjoyed Software Engineering. It's a challenge and not just the same routine everyday. It's working through problems, really using your skills and knowledge to get the job done. Back then, I didn't realize how important technology would become. 

Once I realized Software Engineering aligned with all my needs, flexible schedule for more family time, better pay, and job stability, I started searching for the best fit classes and schools. Beginning these classes has been a challenge but I realize the reward is much greater
